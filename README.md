# Assembly LAFVIN 2WD robot car
1. Gather your components: Ensure that you have all the necessary components required for assembly. This typically includes the chassis, motors, wheels, motor driver board, microcontroller or Arduino board, battery holder, screws, jumper wires, and any additional sensors or modules included in your kit.

2. Assemble the chassis: Start by assembling the main body or chassis of the robotic car according to the instructions provided. Attach the motor brackets or motor mounts to the chassis using screws.

3. Attach the motors: Fix the motors onto the motor brackets using screws. Make sure they are properly aligned and secure.

4. Mount the wheels: Attach the wheels to the motor shafts. Some wheels may have pre-drilled holes for easy attachment, while others may require additional adapters or connectors.

5. Connect the motor driver: Locate the motor driver board in your kit. Connect the motor wires from the motors to the corresponding terminals on the motor driver board. Follow the instructions provided to ensure correct connections.

6. Connect the microcontroller: If your kit includes a microcontroller or Arduino board, connect it to the motor driver board using jumper wires. Ensure the connections are correct based on the instructions.

7. Power supply: Connect the battery holder to the power input on the motor driver board. Ensure that you are using the appropriate voltage and polarity specified by the manufacturer.

8. Additional components: If your kit includes any sensors or additional modules, follow the provided instructions to connect them to the microcontroller or Arduino board. This might involve using jumper wires and following specific pin configurations.

9. Upload code: If required, upload the necessary code or programming onto the microcontroller or Arduino board. This will depend on the specific functionalities and programming capabilities of your kit.

10. Testing: Once everything is connected, double-check all the connections and ensure that there are no loose wires. Power on the robotic car and test its movement by sending appropriate signals to the microcontroller or Arduino board.
